# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## 🎉 Your Static Demo Site is Ready!

I've created a **static showcase website** for your Matnog Tourism Booking System that can be deployed to GitHub Pages, just like the RiseUp project you showed me.

## 📋 Steps to Enable GitHub Pages

### 1. Enable GitHub Pages in Repository Settings

1. **Go to your GitHub repository** (the one we just pushed to)
2. **Click on "Settings"** tab (top right of repository page)
3. **Scroll down to "Pages"** section in the left sidebar
4. **Under "Source"**, select:
   - **Source**: Deploy from a branch
   - **Branch**: `gh-pages`
   - **Folder**: `/ (root)`
5. **Click "Save"**

### 2. Wait for Deployment (2-10 minutes)

GitHub will automatically build and deploy your site. You'll see a green checkmark when it's ready.

### 3. Access Your Live Site

Your site will be available at:
```
https://yourusername.github.io/Capstone_Project_Origin/
```

Replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username.

## 🌟 What's Included in Your GitHub Pages Site

## 🚀 Next Steps After Deployment

### 1. **Update Links in Your Static Site**
Once you know your GitHub username, update these in `index.html`:
```html
<!-- Replace "yourusername" with your actual GitHub username -->
<a href="https://github.com/yourusername/Capstone_Project_Origin">
<a href="mailto:your.email@example.com">
```

### 2. **Cross-Link Your Properties**

- **Share both links** on social media

### 3. **Submit to Search Engines**
